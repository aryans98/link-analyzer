# Link-Analyzer
Built a user-friendly JavaScript application using NodeJS that reveals how a website's internal links work by generating an "<i>internal links</i>" report for any website on the internet by crawling each page of the site.

## Feature ideas to implement
- Make the script run on a timer and deploy it to a server. Have it email every so often with a report.
- Add more robust error checking so that it can crawl larger sites without issues.
- Count external links, as well as internal links, and add them to the report.
- Save the report as a CSV spreadsheet rather than printing it to the console.
- Use a graphics library to create an image that shows the links between the pages as a graph visualization.
- Make requests concurrently to speed up the crawling process.

# Link-Analyzer
  Built a user-friendly JavaScript application using NodeJS that reveals how a website's internal links work by generating an "<i>internal links</i>" report for any website on   the internet by crawling each page of the site.

## To use the application:
  - Clone the repository,
  - Then do "npm install" in order to install the node_modules,
  - And finally in the command line do "npm start <i>link of the website</i>"

## Feature ideas to implement
  - Make the script run on a timer and deploy it to a server. Have it email every so often with a report.
  - Add more robust error checking so that it can crawl larger sites without issues.
  - Count external links, as well as internal links, and add them to the report.
  - Save the report as a CSV spreadsheet rather than printing it to the console.
  - Use a graphics library to create an image that shows the links between the pages as a graph visualization.
  - Make requests concurrently to speed up the crawling process.
